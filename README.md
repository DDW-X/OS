## 📌 Purpose of DeepSick

DeepSick is an advanced adversarial simulation and red teaming framework designed for:

- Simulating modern rootkit/bootkit behavior
- Testing anti-malware/forensic systems under hostile conditions
- Executing kernel-level payloads in controlled environments
- Studying covert operation & stealth mechanisms
- Enhancing cybersecurity education for low-level OS research

> It is **not** a tool for malicious use — it’s a **controlled mirror** of cyberwarfare.

## 🌍 Why Some Parts Are in Persian (Farsi)?

- It’s the native language of the core research team.
- Enhances clarity for complex kernel/system-level operations.
- Prevents code misuse by inexperienced individuals.
- Adds a soft shield against black-hat weaponization.

If needed, use **Google Translate** or **DeepL** for accurate understanding.

## ⚙️ Multi-Environment Code Footprint

You may notice segments written for:

- Windows NT Kernel
- BIOS/UEFI firmware
- Pseudo Firmware Emulators
- Obfuscated logic or detached stubs

This is **intentional** — to resist commodification, enforce operational layering, and confuse low-skill abuse.

## 🔬 Capabilities Snapshot

| Category        | Capability |
|----------------|------------|
| Kernel Ops     | Rootkit Deployment, Anti-Forensics |
| Bootloader     | Bootkits via MBR/VBR Injection |
| Firmware       | Direct Flash Region Access |
| Disk Layer     | Irreversible Wipe Logic |
| Networking     | Obfuscated & Encapsulated C2 Protocols |
| Payload Mgmt   | Modular Hot-Swappable Binaries |
| Detection Evasion | Full Stack Stealth Logic |

**⚠️ Testing outside isolated VMs can brick systems!**

## 🚨 Legal, Ethical & Safety Guidelines

Do **NOT** use this project if you:

- Lack advanced knowledge in system internals
- Plan to test on third-party or live environments
- Don’t have **explicit authorization** from device owners
- Seek thrill, challenge, or chaos over lawful research

> Violations may breach international cybercrime laws and ethical standards.

## 🧭 Philosophy, Intent & Ethics

This project:
- 🛑 Is not malware
- 📚 Is an educational & research simulator
- 🧠 Respects ethical hacking

We do **not** support misuse.

We **do** support:

- Free knowledge for defenders
- Open dialogue about offensive strategies (in ethical labs)
- Advanced cyber defense readiness

“All code is moral. The only question is: whose morality?”

## 💀 Red Teams Only. Not for Beginners.

DeepSick is **not** Metasploit. It’s a **scalpel**.

Ideal users must know:

- 🧬 Kernel-level development (C, Assembly)
- 🧪 VM isolation (QEMU, VMWare)
- 🔐 Firmware & BIOS architectures
- 🛠️ Reverse Engineering & Operational Security

---

## 🧠 Extra Features

- ✅ TLA+ Logical Model Draft (in progress)
- ✅ Post-Quantum Ready Protocol Layer (planned)
- ✅ Runtime Signature Randomizer (polymorphic payloads)
- ✅ Anti-debug traps and virtual execution paths
- ✅ Telemetry Spoofing Stubs for realism

---

## 📥 Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DDW-X/deepsick.git
cd deepsick
# Follow VM setup instructions in SETUP.md (TBA)
```

> ⚠️ Do **not** run on host OS. Use isolated lab VM.
